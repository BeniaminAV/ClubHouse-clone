React.js, Styled-Component, Full Responsive

I have created a clone of the Clubhouse application using technologies such as ReactJS and Styled-Components. I ensured that the application is full responsive, so it can be used on different devices and screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

I tried to respect the original design of the Clubhouse application as much as possible, so that users feel familiar with the interface of my application. In addition, I made the application easy to use, with an intuitive navigation and clear options for interacting with other users.

To develop the application, I used ReactJS and Styled-Components, two popular technologies in the development of modern and performant web applications. ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Styled-Components is a library that allows defining CSS styles within React components.
